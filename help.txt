h1. rah_function

p. Every function is a @<txp:tag />@. Rah_function allows you to call any PHP function in Textpattern tag syntax. No need for PHP snippets, nor ending nor closing PHP tags -- only thing you need is a XHTML like tag.

h3(#attributes). Attributes

p. The tag is @<txp:rah_function />@ and attributes for it follow.

p. *call*
What function to call with the tag.
Example: @call="base64_encode"@ Default: @""@

p. *thing*
With thing you can choose the argument place for container's contained statement. For example, if @thing="here"@ is the last attribute/argument, then the contained statment is used as the last argument too for the function. If @thing@ is left undefined, contained statement is used as the first argument.
Example: @foo="bar" thing="here" bar="foo"@ Default: _undefined_.

p. *parameter1,parameter2,parameter3,[..]*
Can be anything. All parameters are assigned to the called function. Arguments are assigned in the order parameters are typed.
Example: @foo2="bar" foo1="bar" foo4="bar"@ Default: _undefined_.

h3(#using-the-tag). Using the tag

p. The tag, @<txp:rah_function />@ supports a container tag usage. If the tag is used in a container format, the contained statement/code is used as:

* In the argument place that you chose with @thing="here"@. See Attributes and Examples for more info.
* If @thing@ is left undefined, contained statement is used as the first argument.

p. If the tag is used in a self-closing format, then the contained statement is not used (apparently) and the tag works just with the attributes you set.

p. All arguments/attributes/parameters that are used inside the tag, are assigned to the called function in the order they are defined. If no attributes are used, except the mandatory @call@, then the function is used as is with no arguments.
